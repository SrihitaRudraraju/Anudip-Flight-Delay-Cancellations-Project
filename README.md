## ‚úàÔ∏è Airline Flight Data Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

This Power BI project analyzes historical airline flight data to identify patterns in delays, cancellations, routes, and airline performance. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of flight operations and helps uncover actionable insights to improve airline efficiency and customer satisfaction.

### üìä Project Overview

The dataset contains detailed flight records including:

* **Flight dates and numbers**
* **Airlines and codes**
* **Origin and destination cities**
* **Departure & arrival times**
* **Delays, cancellations, and reasons**
* **Distance and elapsed time**

---

### üß† Key Objectives

* Visualize airline operations and performance
* Identify delay patterns by airline, airport, and weather
* Analyze route efficiency and distance trends
* Detect cancellation and diversion trends

### üìå Actionable Insights

1. **Certain airlines consistently have fewer delays** ‚Äî helpful for travelers or benchmarking.
2. **Weather and NAS (Air Traffic) are major contributors to delay times.**
3. **Airports like Chicago, New York have significantly higher delay percentages.**
4. **Some routes with short distance still face long delays.**
5. **Peak flight hours show higher average delays.**
6. **Cancellations spike around certain dates ‚Äî possibly due to weather or maintenance.**
7. **Origin cities with higher taxi-out times could indicate congestion.**
8. **Late aircraft connections are a major hidden factor behind delays.**
9. **Flights under 500 miles show higher percentage delays vs. longer flights.**
10. **Delta and United show better on-time performance in certain regions.**
